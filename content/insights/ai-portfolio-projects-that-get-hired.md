Your portfolio is often more important than your resume for AI roles. But most portfolios fail to impress. Here's what actually gets you hired—and what hiring managers are tired of seeing.

## What Hiring Managers Actually Look For

We interviewed hiring managers at AI companies. Here's what they said:

**What impresses:**
- "Projects that solve real problems, not tutorials"
- "Evidence of iteration based on feedback"
- "Production thinking—deployment, monitoring, evaluation"
- "Clear documentation of decisions and tradeoffs"

**What doesn't:**
- "Another chatbot with LangChain"
- "Tutorial projects with minor modifications"
- "Code without explanation"
- "Impressive-sounding but non-functional demos"

## Portfolio Projects That Get Interviews

### Tier 1: Production-Quality Projects

These demonstrate you can ship real software.

**RAG System for a Real Domain**

Not just another "chat with PDF." Build for a specific use case:
- Legal document Q&A with citation
- Technical documentation search with code examples
- Medical literature review with source verification

**What to demonstrate:**
- Chunking strategy and why you chose it
- Retrieval optimization experiments
- Evaluation metrics and how you measured
- Production considerations (caching, costs, latency)

**AI-Powered Tool with Users**

Build something people actually use:
- Developer tool (code review, documentation)
- Productivity tool (writing, research)
- Domain-specific assistant

**What to demonstrate:**
- User feedback and iteration
- Analytics on usage
- Real-world error handling
- Cost management at scale

**Evaluation Framework**

Create tooling for AI quality:
- Custom evaluation harness for a specific use case
- A/B testing framework for LLM variants
- Automated regression testing for prompts

**What to demonstrate:**
- Understanding of AI quality metrics
- Systematic testing approach
- Data-driven decision making

### Tier 2: Depth Projects

These show you can go deep on specific problems.

**Fine-Tuning Case Study**

Fine-tune a model for a specific task:
- Collect or curate training data
- Document training process
- Compare to base model rigorously
- Deploy and evaluate in practice

**What to demonstrate:**
- Data preparation skills
- Understanding of training dynamics
- Evaluation methodology
- When fine-tuning beats prompting

**Agent System with Reliability**

Build an agent that actually works:
- Multi-step workflow with real tools
- Error handling and recovery
- Observability and tracing
- Cost and latency optimization

**What to demonstrate:**
- Production engineering mindset
- Understanding of agent failure modes
- Systematic approach to reliability

**Open Source Contribution**

Meaningful contribution to AI projects:
- LangChain, LlamaIndex feature or fix
- HuggingFace model or dataset
- Evaluation benchmarks
- Documentation improvements

**What to demonstrate:**
- Ability to work with existing codebases
- Community collaboration
- Code quality standards

### Tier 3: Learning Projects

Acceptable for early career, but not sufficient alone.

**Tutorial-Based Projects (With Extensions)**

If you must include these:
- Add significant original extensions
- Apply to a novel domain
- Include evaluation and comparison
- Document what you learned

**Code-Alongs with Analysis**

If reimplementing papers or tutorials:
- Add your own analysis
- Compare different approaches
- Document failure cases
- Extend beyond the original

## What NOT to Include

### Portfolio Killers

**Generic chatbot:**
> "I built a chatbot using LangChain and OpenAI"

Every candidate has this. It shows you can follow a tutorial.

**No deployment:**
> "Here's my Jupyter notebook"

If it's not deployed, it's not a product. Deploy something.

**No evaluation:**
> "It works pretty well"

How well? Measured how? Compared to what?

**Code without context:**
> [GitHub repo with no README]

Hiring managers won't dig through your code to understand what it does.

### Common Mistakes

**Too many projects:**
3-5 quality projects > 15 mediocre ones

**No documentation:**
A good README is worth more than clever code

**Outdated projects:**
Projects from 2+ years ago with old APIs look stale

**No live demos:**
"Clone the repo and run it" is friction that kills interest

## How to Present Your Portfolio

### Project Documentation Template

For each project, include:

**Overview (2-3 sentences)**
What it does, who it's for, why it matters

**Technical Architecture**
Diagram or description of components

**Key Decisions**
Why you made the choices you did

**Challenges and Solutions**
Problems you encountered and how you solved them

**Results**
Metrics, user feedback, learnings

**Links**
- Live demo (if available)
- GitHub repo
- Blog post or writeup

### Portfolio Website

Simple is better:
- Clean, professional design
- Fast loading
- Mobile-friendly
- Easy navigation

**Include:**
- Brief intro
- 3-5 featured projects
- Links to GitHub, LinkedIn
- Contact info

**Skip:**
- Elaborate animations
- Stock photos
- Vague mission statements
- Excessive personal details

### GitHub Profile

Your GitHub is part of your portfolio:
- Pinned repos should be your best work
- READMEs should be polished
- Recent activity shows you're active
- Contribution graph should have green

## Building Portfolio Projects Strategically

### Time Allocation

If you have 3 months to build a portfolio:

**Month 1: One Deep Project**
Build one production-quality project thoroughly
- Solve a real problem
- Deploy and iterate
- Document extensively

**Month 2: Breadth Projects**
Add 2-3 smaller projects showing range
- Different AI skills (RAG, agents, evaluation)
- Different technologies
- Quick but complete

**Month 3: Polish and Present**
- Write documentation
- Create demos
- Build portfolio site
- Practice explaining projects

### Project Selection Matrix

| Project Type | Demonstrates | Time Required |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| RAG system | Core AI engineering | 2-4 weeks |
| Agent workflow | Advanced skills | 3-5 weeks |
| Evaluation framework | Production mindset | 2-3 weeks |
| Fine-tuning project | Deep ML skills | 3-4 weeks |
| Open source contribution | Collaboration | Ongoing |

Choose based on target roles:
- RAG + deployment → most AI engineer roles
- Agents + reliability → startup/advanced roles
- Fine-tuning + evaluation → ML-heavy roles

## Talking About Your Portfolio in Interviews

### Prepare Stories

For each project, have ready:
- 30-second summary
- 2-minute deep dive
- Answers to "what would you do differently?"
- Answers to "what was the hardest part?"

### Anticipate Questions

> "Walk me through the architecture"
> "Why did you choose [technology]?"
> "What were the tradeoffs?"
> "How did you evaluate quality?"
> "What would you improve?"
> "How would this scale?"

### Be Honest About Limitations

Interviewers respect self-awareness:
- "This was a learning project, so I cut corners on X"
- "In production, I'd add Y"
- "I tried Z but it didn't work because..."

## The Bottom Line

Your portfolio is your proof of capability. In a market where everyone has access to the same tutorials and APIs, what distinguishes you is the quality of what you've built and your ability to explain it.

Focus on depth over breadth. Build 3-5 projects that demonstrate production thinking, real problem-solving, and clear communication. Document extensively. Deploy when possible. Be ready to discuss decisions and tradeoffs.

A strong portfolio can overcome gaps in experience or credentials. A weak portfolio can sink a strong resume. Invest the time to get it right.
