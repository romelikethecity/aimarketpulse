## Cost of Living Adjusted Analysis

Raw salary doesn't tell the full story. Here's what matters:

### Effective Income Comparison

Assuming a $200K base salary in San Francisco as the baseline:

| City | Equivalent Salary | Effective Premium/Discount |
|------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| San Francisco | $200K (baseline) | — |
| New York | $195K | -2.5% |
| Seattle | $190K | +15% (no state tax) |
| Austin | $175K | +25% (no state tax, lower COL) |
| Denver | $170K | +20% (lower COL) |
| Atlanta | $155K | +30% (much lower COL) |
| Remote (from low-COL) | $175K | +40-60% (varies widely) |

**Key insight:** A $175K salary in Austin often provides more purchasing power than $200K in San Francisco.

### State Income Tax Impact

Annual tax difference on $200K salary vs no-income-tax states:

| State | Approx. State Tax on $200K |
|-------|---------------------------|
| California | $18,000 - $22,000 |
| New York | $14,000 - $17,000 |
| Massachusetts | $10,000 - $12,000 |
| Colorado | $9,000 - $10,000 |
| Texas | $0 |
| Washington | $0 |
| Florida | $0 |

Moving from California to Texas at the same salary is effectively a $20K raise.

- Network effects matter more
- Higher absolute salary compounds
- More opportunities to change roles

**Mid-Career (5-10 years):**
- Geographic arbitrage becomes more valuable
- Network already built
- Remote viable with reputation
- Family considerations increase

**Senior (10+ years):**
- Location matters less
- Remote often optimal
- Consulting/advisory work location-flexible
- Quality of life prioritized

## The Bottom Line

AI engineer salaries vary 40-60% between highest and lowest markets. But cost of living and taxes can flip the effective value. A $175K salary in Austin with no state income tax often provides more purchasing power than $200K in San Francisco.

Consider your total picture: salary, cost of living, taxes, quality of life, and career growth potential. The "best" location depends on your stage, priorities, and willingness to trade off different factors.

For maximum compensation, target location-agnostic remote roles or negotiate hard in Tier 1 markets. For maximum quality of life, consider Tier 2-3 markets with strong effective income.
