## FAQs

### Is AV a stable career given industry layoffs?

AV has experienced cycles, but the long-term trajectory is positive. Trucking and robotaxi companies are now generating revenue, not just burning capital. Focus on companies with clear paths to commercialization and strong balance sheets. Your skills (perception, prediction, planning) transfer to robotics, drones, and other industries if needed.

### Do I need a PhD to work in AV AI?

No, but it depends on the role. Research scientist positions often prefer PhDs, but engineering roles (perception engineer, planning engineer) value practical skills and production experience. Many successful AV engineers have bachelor's or master's degrees with strong project portfolios. What matters most is demonstrated ability to build working systems.
