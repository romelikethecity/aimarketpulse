## What Q1 2026 Hiring Looks Like

### Shift Toward Senior Hires

Companies are consolidating teams and hiring experienced engineers:

- 62% of roles are Senior, Staff, or Principal level
- Junior AI roles are increasingly rare
- Mid-level requires demonstrable production experience
- "AI-curious" engineers are less attractive than before

### Specialization Over Generalists

Specific expertise is valued:

- **RAG specialists**: High demand for complex retrieval systems
- **Fine-tuning experts**: Companies moving beyond prompt engineering
- **AI safety/evals**: Growing need for quality assurance
- **Multi-modal**: Image, video, audio AI expanding

### Remote Policy Tightening

Trends in location flexibility:

- Fully remote roles decreased 12% from Q4 2025
- Hybrid (2-3 days) is the most common policy
- Return-to-office mandates affecting some big tech roles
- Remote-first companies gaining competitive advantage

## Getting Hired in Q1 2026

### What's Working

**Strong portfolios**: GitHub projects with RAG systems, evaluation frameworks, or production-quality code

**Specific expertise**: Deep knowledge in one area (retrieval, fine-tuning, agents) beats shallow breadth

**Production stories**: "I built X that served Y users with Z results"

**Open-source presence**: Contributions to LangChain, LlamaIndex, or similar projects

### What's Not Working

**Tutorial projects only**: Everyone has built a chatbot with LangChain

**Vague experience**: "Worked with LLMs" without specifics

**Pure research background**: Companies want engineers who can ship

**AI hype without substance**: Buzzword-heavy resumes with unclear impact

## Companies to Watch

### Growing Teams

Companies we expect to increase AI hiring in Q2:

- **Perplexity**: Search AI, rapidly scaling
- **Character.ai**: Consumer AI applications
- **Glean**: Enterprise search and RAG
- **Writer**: Enterprise content AI
- **Harvey**: Legal AI, well-funded

### Stable Employers

Consistent hiring, good reputation:

- **Databricks**: ML platform and LLM applications
- **Snowflake**: Data + AI integration
- **MongoDB**: Vector search expansion
- **Elastic**: Search + AI convergence

### Caution Areas

Companies with recent layoffs or uncertain funding should be researched carefully. AI hiring can be volatile.

## Salary Benchmarks Q1 2026

Current market rates for AI engineering roles:

| Level | Base | Total Comp |
|-------|------|------------|
| Junior (0-2 yrs) | $125K-160K | $140K-180K |
| Mid (2-5 yrs) | $160K-210K | $190K-260K |
| Senior (5-8 yrs) | $200K-260K | $250K-340K |
| Staff (8+ yrs) | $250K-320K | $320K-450K |

Equity varies dramatically by company stage. Big tech RSUs are reliable; startup equity is speculative.

## How to Stand Out

### Before Applying

1. Research the company's AI products/features
2. Identify how your skills map to their needs
3. Have a project that demonstrates relevant experience
4. Prepare specific stories about production AI work

### In Interviews

1. Lead with impact, not technology
2. Discuss tradeoffs you've navigated
3. Show you understand evaluation and iteration
4. Demonstrate cost and latency awareness

### Negotiation

1. Have competing offers if possible
2. Understand the equity component deeply
3. Research the company's compensation philosophy
4. Don't accept the first offer

## The Bottom Line

Q1 2026 AI hiring favors experienced engineers with production credentials. The companies above are actively hiring, but competition is fierce for the best roles. Focus on demonstrable expertise, specific skills, and clear impact stories. The market rewards depth over breadth and shipping over studying.

Start with companies whose products excite you—enthusiasm and domain knowledge show in interviews.
