The titles "ML Engineer" and "AI Engineer" often appear interchangeable, but they describe increasingly distinct roles. Understanding the difference matters for your career path, job search, and skill development.

## The Core Distinction

**ML Engineer**: Builds and deploys machine learning models. Focuses on training, optimization, and serving custom models.

**AI Engineer**: Builds applications using AI capabilities. Focuses on integrating LLMs, APIs, and pre-trained models into products.

The ML engineer trains models. The AI engineer uses them.

## How the Roles Evolved

### ML Engineer (2015-present)

ML engineering emerged from data science as companies needed to productionize models:

- Data scientists built models in notebooks
- Companies needed those models in production
- ML engineers bridged research and deployment
- Focus: training pipelines, model serving, MLOps

### AI Engineer (2022-present)

AI engineering emerged with LLMs and foundation models:

- LLMs made powerful AI accessible via API
- Companies needed to integrate AI into products
- AI engineers built applications, not models
- Focus: RAG, prompt engineering, application development

## Skills Comparison

## Compensation Comparison

Based on our analysis of job postings:

| Level | ML Engineer | AI Engineer |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Junior | $130K-165K | $125K-160K |
| Mid | $165K-210K | $160K-200K |
| Senior | $200K-270K | $195K-260K |
| Staff | $250K-340K | $240K-320K |

ML engineers command a slight premium due to:
- Deeper technical requirements
- Longer time to proficiency
- Established career ladder

AI engineer compensation is rising rapidly as demand outpaces supply.

## Job Market Dynamics

### ML Engineer Market

**Trends:**
- Stable demand, mature market
- Consolidation around proven tools
- Increasing platform/infrastructure focus
- Specialization required at senior levels

**Companies hiring:**

## Which Should You Choose?

### Choose ML Engineering If:

- You enjoy building and training models
- Math and statistics excite you
- You want deep specialization
- You're interested in research applications
- You prefer optimizing over building

### Choose AI Engineering If:

- You enjoy building products
- You're excited by LLMs and what they enable
- You want to ship features fast
- You prefer breadth over depth
- You're comfortable with rapid tool change

### Career Switching

**ML Engineer → AI Engineer:**
- Relatively easy transition
- Your ML knowledge is advantageous
- Add RAG, prompt engineering, application skills
- Timeline: 1-3 months

**AI Engineer → ML Engineer:**
- More challenging transition
- Requires deeper math/stats foundation
- Need training pipeline experience
- Timeline: 6-12 months

## The Blurring Line

At senior levels, the distinction often blurs:

**Senior AI engineers** increasingly need:
- Fine-tuning capabilities
- Model selection expertise
- Custom model evaluation
- MLOps basics

**Senior ML engineers** increasingly need:
- LLM integration knowledge
- Prompt engineering for evals
- RAG understanding
- Application context

The T-shaped engineer—deep in one area, broad in the other—is most valuable.

## Interview Differences

### ML Engineer Interviews

- Coding with algorithm focus
- ML fundamentals (bias-variance, overfitting)
- System design for ML training/serving
- Statistics and probability questions
- Paper discussions (at research-focused companies)

### AI Engineer Interviews

- Coding with application focus
- RAG system design
- LLM-specific knowledge (prompt engineering, context windows)
- Product-oriented system design
- Fewer math questions, more application questions

## The Future

Our prediction for the next 2-3 years:

**ML Engineering:**
- Becomes more specialized (foundations, training, optimization)
- Higher barrier to entry
- Focused on frontier model development
- Premium compensation for deep expertise

**AI Engineering:**
- Becomes the default "AI role"
- Absorbs aspects of full-stack, backend engineering
- Tool maturity reduces skill requirements
- Broader hiring, more competition

Both paths lead to rewarding careers. The choice depends on whether you're more excited by building the models or building with them.

## The Bottom Line

ML engineers build and train models. AI engineers build applications using models. The distinction matters more at junior/mid levels than senior levels, where cross-functional skills are expected.

If you're drawn to the science of machine learning—training, optimization, architecture—pursue ML engineering. If you're drawn to building AI-powered products—applications, user experiences, integration—pursue AI engineering.

Both roles need strong engineers. Choose based on what work energizes you.
