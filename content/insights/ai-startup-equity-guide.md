AI startup equity can be worth millions—or nothing. Understanding how to evaluate equity offers is critical when considering AI startup roles. Here's what you need to know.

## The AI Startup Equity Reality

Let's start with honest statistics:

- ~90% of startups fail or return less than invested
- ~70% of seed-stage startups fail completely
- ~50% of Series A startups fail or provide minimal returns
- When successful, early employees can see 10-100x returns

**The math:**
- Expected value often favors big tech RSUs
- Actual outcomes are binary (big win or near-zero)
- Your risk tolerance should guide decisions

## Understanding Your Equity Offer

### Key Terms

**Stock Options (ISO/NSO)**
The right to buy shares at a set price (strike price).
- ISOs: Tax-advantaged, but complex AMT implications
- NSOs: Ordinary income on exercise, simpler

**Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)**
Actual shares granted, vest over time. More common at later stages.

**Shares vs Percentage**
Always ask for percentage ownership, not just share count.
- "50,000 shares" is meaningless without total shares outstanding
- 0.1% of a $1B company = $1M at full dilution

### Vesting Schedule

Standard: 4 years with 1-year cliff
- Year 1: 25% vests after cliff
- Years 2-4: Monthly or quarterly vesting

**Watch for:**
- Acceleration clauses (single/double trigger)
- Early exercise options
- Post-termination exercise windows

### Exercise Window

How long you have to buy your options after leaving:
- 90 days (standard, bad for employees)
- Extended (7-10 years, increasingly common)
- Early exercise available

**This matters:** Leaving a startup with 90-day exercise window can mean paying $50K+ or losing unvested options.

## Evaluating AI Startup Equity

### Step 1: Understand Your Percentage

Ask: "What percentage of the company will I own fully diluted?"

**Typical ranges by stage:**

| Stage | Engineering IC | Senior/Staff | Leadership |
|-------|----------------|--------------|------------|
| Seed | 0.25% - 1.0% | 0.5% - 2.0% | 1% - 5% |
| Series A | 0.1% - 0.5% | 0.25% - 1.0% | 0.5% - 2% |
| Series B | 0.05% - 0.25% | 0.1% - 0.5% | 0.25% - 1% |
| Series C+ | 0.01% - 0.1% | 0.05% - 0.25% | 0.1% - 0.5% |

AI startups often offer slightly higher percentages due to talent competition.

### Step 2: Understand Dilution

Your percentage will shrink with each funding round:

**Example:**
- You join at 0.5% after Series A
- Series B raises dilutes by 20% → you're at 0.4%
- Series C dilutes by 20% → you're at 0.32%
- Exit at 0.32% (36% less than starting)

Assume 50-70% dilution from early stage to exit.

### Step 3: Calculate Potential Outcomes

**Scenario analysis for 0.1% equity:**

| Exit Outcome | Your Equity Value |
|--------------|------------------|
| Company fails | $0 |
| $50M exit (acqui-hire) | $50K (before preference) |
| $200M exit | $200K (before preference) |
| $500M exit | $500K |
| $1B exit | $1M |
| $5B exit (rare) | $5M |

**Key caveat:** Liquidation preferences mean early scenarios often pay nothing to common shareholders.

### Step 4: Understand Liquidation Preferences

Investors get paid before common shareholders:

**1x non-participating preference (standard):**
Investors get their money back first, or convert to common (whichever is higher).

**Example:**
- Investors put in $50M
- Exit at $60M
- Investors take $50M, employees split $10M
- At 0.1%, you get $10K, not $60K

**Participating preferred (worse for employees):**
Investors get their money back AND their pro-rata share.

**Key insight:** Most exits under $100M return very little to employees.

### Step 5: Probability Weight Your Scenarios

**Rough probability framework:**

| Outcome | Probability | Value at 0.1% | Expected Value |
|---------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| Failure | 50% | $0 | $0 |
| Small exit (<$100M) | 25% | $20K | $5K |
| Medium exit ($100-500M) | 15% | $200K | $30K |
| Large exit ($500M-1B) | 8% | $700K | $56K |
| Huge exit (>$1B) | 2% | $2M+ | $40K+ |
| **Expected value** | | | ~$130K |

This $130K expected value competes against known RSU value at big tech.

## AI Startup Red Flags

**Run away if:**
- They won't share percentage ownership
- No 409A valuation available
- 90-day exercise window with high strike price
- Unclear cap table
- Excessive liquidation preferences

**Concerns but negotiable:**
- Below-market percentage for stage
- Standard 90-day window (ask for extension)
- No acceleration on acquisition

## Negotiation Strategies

### What to Negotiate

**Percentage:** Always negotiate. There's usually room.

**Exercise window:** Ask for 7-10 year window (increasingly common).

**Acceleration:** Single trigger (vesting accelerates on acquisition) or double trigger (accelerates if you're terminated after acquisition).

**Early exercise:** Ability to buy shares before vesting (for tax reasons).

### How to Negotiate

> "I'm excited about the opportunity. The equity package is important to me—can you share the fully diluted percentage and any flexibility there?"

> "I understand the 90-day exercise window is standard, but given the strike price, could we discuss extending it to 7-10 years?"

> "What are the liquidation preferences for the preferred shares?"

## Comparing to Big Tech RSUs

**Big Tech (e.g., $300K total comp, 50% RSUs):**
- $150K/year in RSUs
- Liquid, predictable value
- Vest over 4 years
- Total: ~$600K over 4 years (known)

**AI Startup (e.g., 0.1% equity):**
- Expected value ~$130K (uncertain)
- Illiquid for years
- May vest to worthless
- Upside case: $500K-5M+ (rare)

**The decision framework:**
- Choose RSUs for predictability and lower risk
- Choose startup for asymmetric upside and mission
- Never take startup equity assuming it will pay off

## Tax Considerations

### ISOs

- No tax on exercise (but AMT may apply)
- Long-term capital gains if held 2+ years from grant, 1+ year from exercise
- Can be very tax-efficient

### NSOs

- Ordinary income on spread at exercise
- Capital gains on subsequent appreciation
- Simpler but higher taxes

### 83(b) Election

If you early exercise, file 83(b) within 30 days:
- Pay tax on current value (often low)
- All future appreciation is capital gains
- Can save significant taxes

**Critical:** Miss the 30-day window and you can't fix it.

## Due Diligence Questions

Before accepting, ask:

1. What's my fully diluted percentage?
2. What's the current 409A valuation?
3. What are the liquidation preferences?
4. What's the post-termination exercise window?
5. Is early exercise available?
6. What's the company's runway and path to profitability?
7. What happened in the last funding round?
8. What's the cap table breakdown (founders vs investors vs employees)?

## The Bottom Line

AI startup equity is a bet, not a guarantee. The expected value often favors big tech RSUs, but the upside tail can be life-changing.

Evaluate equity critically:
- Get your percentage ownership
- Understand dilution and preferences
- Run probability-weighted scenarios
- Negotiate terms that matter
- Never accept below-market cash for equity you're not confident in

The best approach: take startup equity for the mission and learning, with equity as a potential bonus—not as your primary compensation strategy.
