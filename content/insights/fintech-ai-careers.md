> "How would you build a real-time fraud detection system that minimizes false positives?"

> "Design a credit scoring model that's both accurate and explainable"

> "How do you handle non-stationarity in financial time series?"

### Domain Questions

> "What's the difference between market risk and credit risk?"

> "How do fair lending laws affect model development?"

> "What is model risk management?"

### Case Studies

## The Bottom Line

Fintech AI offers premium compensation—often 20-40% above general AI roles—for engineers who can combine technical AI skills with financial domain knowledge. The quantitative rigor required is higher, but so are the rewards.

The field values measurable impact. If you can show that your work reduced fraud by X basis points or improved model accuracy by Y%, you'll advance quickly. Finance is numbers-driven, and that extends to how it evaluates AI talent.

Start with solid AI fundamentals, add financial domain knowledge, and target companies where your skills create measurable value. The compensation premium reflects both the difficulty and the opportunity.

## FAQs

### Do I need a finance degree to work in fintech AI?

No, but you need to learn financial concepts. Many successful fintech AI engineers come from pure CS or math backgrounds and learn finance on the job. However, understanding basic financial instruments, risk concepts, and regulatory requirements will significantly accelerate your career.

### How does fintech AI compensation compare to FAANG?

Fintech AI generally pays 20-40% more than equivalent FAANG roles, with trading firms paying 50-100% premiums. However, this varies significantly by role type—fraud detection at a payments company might match FAANG, while quant research at a hedge fund can far exceed it. Bonus structures also differ, with trading roles having more variable compensation.
