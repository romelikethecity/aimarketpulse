## The Bottom Line

AI creates opportunities beyond engineering. Product managers, ethicists, trainers, strategists, and operators all play essential roles as companies adopt AI. The key is building genuine AI literacy—understanding what these systems can do, where they fail, and how to work with them effectively.

Start by becoming an AI power user, then develop specialized knowledge in your domain. The non-technical roles that require judgment, strategy, and domain expertise are growing faster than automation can eliminate them.

You don't need to code to have a career in AI. You need to understand AI well enough to add value around it.
