You don't need a computer science degree to work in AI. Many successful AI professionals come from marketing, sales, operations, and other non-technical backgrounds. Here's the realistic path to making the transition.

## The Non-Technical AI Opportunity

AI companies need more than engineers:

**High-demand non-technical roles:**
- AI Product Manager
- AI Operations Specialist
- AI Trainer / Data Quality Lead
- AI Ethics and Governance
- AI Sales and Solutions
- AI Program Manager
- AI Content and Education

**Why companies need you:**
- Engineers can build AI but often struggle to explain it
- Business context is essential for AI to create value
- Domain expertise beats technical skills for many AI applications
- Scale requires non-engineers (you can't have all engineers)

## Realistic Expectations

Let's be honest about what's possible:

**Achievable without coding:**
- AI product roles (PM, design, research)
- AI operations and implementation
- AI training and data quality
- AI sales and customer success
- AI ethics and policy
- AI program management

**Requires technical skills:**
- AI engineering (obviously)
- ML engineering
- Data science with ML
- MLOps

**Salary reality:**
Non-technical AI roles typically pay $90K-$200K depending on level and specialization. This is less than engineering roles but often higher than equivalent non-AI positions.
