Start learning the regulatory landscape now—the EU AI Act and its global counterparts will shape AI development for decades.

## FAQs

### Do I need a technical background for AI compliance roles?

It depends on the role. AI governance and ethics roles often don't require deep technical skills—regulatory and policy expertise is more important. However, AI technical compliance engineering roles need strong technical backgrounds. Most roles benefit from "technical literacy"—understanding how AI systems work at a conceptual level without needing to build them.

### Which regulation should I learn first?

Start with the EU AI Act since it's the most comprehensive and influential globally. Even if you're focused on the US market, many organizations are aligning with EU AI Act requirements as a baseline. Then add sector-specific knowledge (FDA for healthcare, SEC for finance) based on your industry focus. The NIST AI Risk Management Framework is also valuable for understanding risk-based approaches.
