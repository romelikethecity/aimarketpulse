Not all AI job postings are created equal. Some signal great opportunities; others are traps. Here's how to read between the lines and identify red flags before you apply.

## Red Flags in Job Descriptions

### Buzzword Overload

**Warning signs:**
> "Leverage synergies between AI/ML paradigms to drive transformational outcomes across the enterprise"

> "World-class AI ninja rockstar to disrupt the industry"

**What it means:**
- They don't understand AI
- Marketing wrote the job description
- Role may be poorly defined

**Acceptable:**
> "Build RAG systems for customer support using LangChain and vector databases"

Specificity indicates they know what they need.

### Unrealistic Requirements

**Warning signs:**
> "5+ years of LLM experience required"

(LLMs were niche until 2022)

> "Expert in GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama, Mistral, AND deep experience with fine-tuning, RLHF, and multi-agent systems"

**What it means:**
- They're copying competitor job postings
- They don't understand the market
- Expectations may be unrealistic

**Watch for:**
- Requirements that don't match the level (senior skills for junior pay)
- Every hot technology listed
- Years of experience with new technologies

### Vague Responsibilities

**Warning signs:**
> "Work on AI stuff"
> "Support various AI initiatives"
> "Help with ML projects as needed"

**What it means:**
- They don't have a clear AI strategy
- You might be doing random work
- Role may not have real impact

**Better:**
> "Build and maintain our product recommendation system"
> "Design RAG architecture for customer support"

Specific responsibilities indicate real work.

### No Salary Range

**In states that require it:**
Red flag for compliance culture

**In other states:**
Expect lowball offers

**What to do:**
Ask for range early. If they won't share, proceed cautiously.

## Interview Process Red Flags

### Disorganized Process

**Warning signs:**
- Interviewers don't know what role you're interviewing for
- No clear interview structure
- Rescheduling multiple times
- Interviewers are unprepared

**What it means:**
- Company culture may be chaotic
- AI team may be neglected
- You'll likely experience similar dysfunction

### Can't Explain the AI Work

**Warning signs:**
- Vague answers about current AI projects
- Can't describe the tech stack
- "We're still figuring out our AI strategy"

**What it means:**
- AI may be more talk than reality
- You might be building from scratch with no support
- Expectations may be undefined

**Ask:**
> "Can you describe a recent AI project and its impact?"
> "What's the current AI stack?"

### Everyone Is New

**Warning signs:**
- "We're building the AI team from scratch"
- No one has been there more than 6 months
- High turnover signals

**What it means:**
- May indicate problems with the role
- You won't have mentorship
- Past AI efforts may have failed

### Pressure Tactics

**Warning signs:**
- "We need a decision by tomorrow"
- "This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity"
- Discouraging you from talking to other companies

**What it means:**
- Likely hiding something
- Desperate to fill the role
- May have lost other candidates

### Technical Interview Mismatches

**Warning signs:**
- Interview doesn't match job description
- Asked about skills not mentioned in posting
- Interview seems designed for a different role

**What it means:**
- They're unsure what they need
- Job may change after you join
- Internal misalignment

## Compensation Red Flags

### Below-Market Pay

**Current market for AI engineers (2026):**
- Mid-level: $160K - $210K
- Senior: $200K - $270K
- Staff: $250K - $340K

**Red flags:**
- 20%+ below market with no equity upside
- "Competitive" with no specifics
- "Equity heavy" with unclear valuation

### Equity Concerns

**Warning signs:**
- Won't share percentage ownership
- No 409A valuation available
- 90-day exercise window with high strike price
- Excessive liquidation preferences
- "Trust us, the equity will be worth a lot"

### Variable/Performance Pay

**Warning signs:**
- Large portion of comp is "performance-based"
- Unclear bonus criteria
- History of not hitting bonus targets

## Company Red Flags

### Pivot to AI

**Warning signs:**
- Traditional company suddenly "becoming AI-first"
- No AI experience on leadership team
- AI as marketing, not product strategy

**Questions to ask:**
- Who leads AI strategy?
- What's the AI budget?
- What AI products are already shipped?

### Funding Concerns

**Warning signs:**
- Last funding was 2+ years ago
- Layoffs in the past year
- Runway concerns in news
- Leadership departures

**For startups:**
- Check Crunchbase for funding history
- Google "[Company] layoffs"
- Check LinkedIn for departure patterns

### Glassdoor and Blind

**Look for:**
- Overall rating (below 3.5 is concerning)
- AI team-specific reviews
- Patterns in negative reviews
- Recent reviews (last 6 months)

**Weight appropriately:**
- One bad review isn't conclusive
- Patterns matter more than individual complaints
- Consider source (frustrated departures vs balanced feedback)

### Product-Market Fit

**Warning signs:**
- No clear product strategy
- Lots of pivoting
- Revenue isn't growing
- Can't explain who the customer is

**Why it matters:**
- Unfocused companies mean unfocused AI work
- Your projects may never ship
- Job security concerns

## Yellow Flags (Caution, Not Rejection)

### Early-Stage Startup

**Not inherently bad, but:**
- Lower base salary likely
- Higher risk
- Less structure
- May be building everything from scratch

**Ask:**
- What's the runway?
- What's the equity package?
- What's the AI team structure?

### New AI Team

**Not inherently bad, but:**
- You'll be building foundation
- Less mentorship
- More ambiguity

**Ask:**
- What's the company's AI vision?
- Who is the AI team reporting to?
- What resources are committed?

### Hybrid/Return to Office

**Not inherently bad, but:**
- Understand the policy clearly
- Is it changing?
- What flexibility exists?

## How to Investigate

### Before Applying

- Check Glassdoor and Blind
- Google company news
- Look up team on LinkedIn
- Check product reviews
- Research funding status

### During Interview Process

- Ask detailed questions about the role
- Talk to potential teammates
- Request to speak with recent hires
- Ask about AI project history
- Clarify compensation early

### Questions to Ask

**About the AI work:**
> "What AI projects have shipped in the last year?"
> "Who do AI engineers report to?"
> "What's the current AI tech stack?"

**About the team:**
> "How long has the AI team existed?"
> "What does growth look like for this role?"
> "What happened with the last person in this role?"

**About the company:**
> "What's the company's runway?"
> "How is AI prioritized vs other initiatives?"

## The Bottom Line

Most AI job red flags fall into three categories:

1. **They don't understand AI:** Buzzwords, unrealistic requirements, vague responsibilities
2. **Something's wrong internally:** High turnover, chaos, underpaying
3. **The company isn't solid:** Funding issues, no product-market fit, pivot desperation

Trust your instincts. If multiple things feel off, they probably are. It's better to continue your search than to take a role that will disappoint you in 3 months.

The best AI jobs have: clear responsibilities, fair compensation, experienced teams, and real AI products. Hold out for them.
