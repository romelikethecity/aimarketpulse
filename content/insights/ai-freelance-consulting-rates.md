## Financial Realities

### Income Math

**Target: $250K annual revenue**

At $200/hr:

- ~24 hrs/week billable
- ~60% utilization

At $300/hr:
- Need ~833 billable hours
- ~16 hrs/week billable
- ~40% utilization

**Key insight:** Raising rates is more effective than working more hours.

### Expenses

Budget for:
- Self-employment tax (~15%)
- Health insurance ($500-1,500/month)
- Business insurance ($100-300/month)
- Software and tools ($200-500/month)
- Marketing/networking
- Retirement savings (no employer match)

**Rule of thumb:** Target 2x your W-2 equivalent hourly rate to account for benefits, taxes, and non-billable time.

## Common Mistakes

### Pricing Too Low

Many consultants undercharge. Signs you're too cheap:
- Never getting pushback on rates
- Fully booked 3+ months out
- Clients seem surprised by value

### Unclear Scope

Scope creep kills margins. Always:
- Document scope in writing
- Define what's not included
- Have change order process
- Be willing to say no

### Treating It Like Employment

You're running a business:
- Diversify clients
- Build pipeline constantly
- Say no to bad fits
- Value your time

## The Bottom Line

AI consulting offers strong income potential—$150K-400K+ annually is achievable for skilled practitioners. The market is hungry for AI expertise, and companies increasingly prefer flexible engagement over full-time hires for specialized work.

Start by defining your niche, building credibility through content and network, and pricing appropriately for your experience. Raise rates aggressively as demand grows. The best consultants earn more than equivalent full-time roles while maintaining flexibility and variety.

The key is treating it as a business: deliver exceptional value, maintain healthy margins, and continuously build your reputation and pipeline.
