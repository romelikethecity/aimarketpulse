As a Staff Data Scientist on the Media Science & Experimentation team, you will lead the development of ML-driven audience targeting solutions and help define how experimentation drives onsite media performance. Your work will directly influence how top-tier advertisers activate against Sam’s Club members, how campaigns are optimized in-market, and how value is communicated to executive stakeholders. This is a highly visible role combining advanced machine learning, experimentation rigor, and executive storytelling at scale.

* Advance experimentation for onsite display media  
  Design and analyze rigorous A/B tests to evaluate onsite display ad strategies, validate hypotheses, and inform product and media decisions that improve member experience and monetization.

  Architect and deliver AI-driven solutions that automatically generate executive-ready narratives and presentation materials, dramatically reducing manual reporting while elevating insight quality.
* Influence executive decision-making through storytelling  
  Translate complex analytical findings into compelling narratives for VP-level and above stakeholders — clearly articulating ROI, business impact, and strategic implications.

**What you’ll bring**

* Proven experience building ML models that drive real business impact  
  3+ years of hands-on, non-academic experience developing and deploying ML models end-to-end — particularly propensity and/or LTV models using tree-based methods (XGBoost, LightGBM).
* Strong experimentation and statistical judgment  
  Deep expertise in A/B testing design and analysis, including power analysis, hypothesis testing, and advanced methods (bootstrapping or Bayesian approaches are a plus).

* GenAI and automation mindset  
  Demonstrated ability to leverage LLMs or GenAI tools to automate narrative generation, reporting, or presentation creation from data.
* Ability to bridge data science and executive storytelling  
  A track record of communicating complex analytical results to senior business stakeholders in a clear, persuasive, and strategic way.
* Retail media or AdTech exposure (strong plus)  
  Familiarity with Retail Media Networks, AdTech platforms, or closed-loop measurement environments is highly valued.
* Modern data & ML tooling experience  
  Experience with GCP (BigQuery, Dataproc, Vertex AI preferred), and familiarity with engineering best practices such as CI/CD, Docker, PySpark, or scalable data pipelines.
* Strong quantitative foundation  
  A Master’s degree or PhD in Statistics, Economics, Computer Science, Mathematics, or a related field is preferred.

As a company, we're backed by Y Combinator, General Catalyst, 186 Ventures, Reach Capital and many more tier 1 institutional investment firms. We recently raised an oversubscribed $4.4M seed round from some of the best investors in Silicon Valley.

**Overview**  
BrandPulse builds AI + computer vision technology for sports visibility and sponsorship analytics. We’re hiring a **Fractional CTO** to own our **AWS infrastructure, GPU compute operations**—and to help guide the team as we scale.

**Non-negotiable:** You’ve owned **production AWS operations** (deployments, monitoring/alerting, incident response, cost controls) and have **hands-on AWS GPU experience**.

**Why this role**

This is a front-seat opportunity for a senior technical leader who wants CTO-level ownership—starting fractional while we ship key milestones, with a targeted ramp to full-time as we grow.

What you’ll own

1) Cloud & AI operations on AWS (core)

* Create and manage AWS environments (dev/stage/prod), set up guardrails, and keep the platform stable
* Own deployments, CI/CD, monitoring/logging, alerting, backups, and incident response
* Establish cost controls (budgets, alerts, optimization) and manage GPU spend proactively
* Own AWS security & connectivity: IAM roles/policies, secrets management, VPC/security groups, audit trail, least-privilege access

2) AWS GPU operations (core)

* Own GPU compute strategy on AWS: instance/service selection, provisioning, scaling approach, utilization, and reliability
* Support production inference/training operations with runbooks, observability, and rollback plans
* Optimize GPU cost/performance and ensure workloads “work in production”

3) Technical leadership + external communication (core)

* Lead technical demos and architecture reviews with external stakeholders (partners/customers)
* Explain roadmap, tradeoffs, and system design clearly to non-technical audiences
* Lead a small senior team (Full-Stack Engineer + AI Engineer) and set lightweight standards (code review, documentation, release process)

4) Computer vision context (leadership, not primary development)

* Understand CV/ML concepts well enough to guide the AI Engineer, make pragmatic decisions, and ensure production readiness
* Align model work with infrastructure realities (latency, reliability, cost, monitoring)

Must-have experience

* Deep AWS + DevOps ownership in production (not just “familiar with AWS”).
* Proven experience managing cloud cost and reliability tradeoffs.
* AWS security/networking fundamentals (IAM/VPC/secrets).
* Operating GPU workloads on AWS (inference and/or training).
* Ability to lead and execute in an early-stage environment.

Nice to have

* MLOps experience (model versioning, deploy/rollback, monitoring).
* IaC (Terraform/CDK/CloudFormation), containers/orchestration.
* Prior startup leadership (0→1 or early scale).

Compensation

* **Fractional/part-time to start** (scope + weekly hours agreed upfront).

* **Equity included**.

### **Working at Coursedog**

We follow a fixed contribution model to promote equity and transparency. Every employee receives the same annual dollar amount to apply toward medical, dental, and vision coverage. This approach gives you the flexibility to choose the plan that best fits your needs, whether that is a base-level option or more comprehensive coverage.

Depending on the selected coverage level, the company covers:

* Employee-only coverage: 65% to 99% of monthly premiums
* Employee plus dependents: 45% to 75% of monthly premiums

We partner with Aetna and Guardian, and offer access to best-in-class wellness and support programs, including:

We trust our employees to manage their time responsibly. That’s why we offer an unlimited Paid Time Off policy — because flexibility and balance are critical for sustained excellence and personal well-being.

We were built for distributed work. Our culture emphasizes flexibility over rigidity, outcomes over hours, and transparency over gatekeeping. We are committed to being a remote-first organization indefinitely, empowering you to work where and how you thrive best.

As a valued contributor to our collective success, you’ll participate in the upside. All employees are granted equity in the company aligned to your role and tenure. Equity grants are reviewed and adjusted with promotions to reflect your evolving impact.

### **About Coursedog**

Our mission is to break down barriers to opportunity for students.  
  
Coursedog provides higher ed with modern technology solutions – empowering institutions, students, and communities across the globe.  
  
Coursedog's founding story is rooted in the desire to help students achieve their highest goals. In 2018, Coursedog's co-founders and then college students, Justin Wenig and Nick Diao, were frustrated by how difficult it was to get into the classes they needed to graduate on time. After speaking with higher education provosts and registrars to better understand how academic scheduling works, they came away with a vision that permeates the company today.

Coursedog has raised $113M total capital as a remote-first, hyper-growth startup currently backed by JMI Equity, and with past investments from YC and First Round Capital. We were recently ranked in Forbes top 500 US startup employers and our employee engagement scores rank in the top 5% of tech companies.","### **Description**

Sitting within our newly formed Centralized Operations & Systems team, this role owns end-to-end AI enablement — from enterprise strategy and operating model design to hands-on execution, governance, and adoption.

This role owns national retail revenue across mass, drug, and grocery. You will expand distribution, unlock new channels, deepen existing partnerships, and build a sales organization that can scale with the business.  
  
You will personally drive high-impact revenue opportunities while coaching and developing a team of experienced sales managers. You will report directly to the cofounder and operate as a core member of the leadership team.  
  
**Base Salary Range:** $225-$245k per year, commensurate with experience and equity stock options

**Responsibilities**

**What You’ll Be Accountable For:**

* Scaling Flex’s retail revenue to $50mm+ with profitable, sustainable growth
* Expanding distribution and velocity within mass, drug, and grocery
* Opening new channels where Flex is under-penetrated (e.g., Costco, convenience, additional grocery banners)
* Owning national retailer strategy, negotiations, line reviews, and joint business planning
* Leading and developing a team both internal (sales leaders) and external (brokers)
* Partnering closely with CEO, Marketing, Finance, Supply Chain, and Product to align growth, margin, and execution
* Building a repeatable retail growth engine, not just hitting this year’s number

**What You’ll Do:**

* Personally lead high-stakes retail pitches, negotiations, and expansion initiatives
* Set the retail growth strategy and translate it into executable plans by channel and customer
* Coach and level up the existing sales team; hire selectively as the business scales
* Own retailer economics: pricing, trade spend, margins, promotional strategy
* Hold a high bar for accountability, forecasting discipline, and execution without turning the role into ops
* Be the voice of the retailer internally, and the voice of Flex externally

**Requirements**

**Who You Are:**

* You have scaled a retail/wholesale CPG business above $50mm and know what actually breaks at that stage
* You are a hunter by instinct, not just by resume
* You are equally comfortable closing a major account and coaching a sales manager through a tough line review
* You understand mass, drug, grocery retail dynamics deeply and are also familiar in other categories (e.g., dollar, big box, convenience)
* You can articulate a compelling reason why women’s health / femcare is the right category for you to lead
* You move fast, take ownership, and don’t hide behind process
* You want real responsibility, not a “nice” VP title

**Necessary Experience:**

* Senior Director or VP-level experience leading retail sales in CPG
* Direct experience selling into mass, drug, and/or grocery
* Proven success managing the world's largest retailers/accounts
* Experience managing and developing sales leaders
* Comfort operating in a founder-led, high-expectation environment

**Why This Role Is Hard (and Worth It):**

* Mission driven making a huge difference in peoples’ lives (look at our reviews)
* The business already works - your job is to make it much bigger
* Growth will come from both new doors and doing more with existing ones
* You’ll be expected to lead, not wait for perfect information
* You’ll have real influence on the future shape of the company

**Our shared values**

* **Lead with Intention**: Leaders are made not born. Leadership is a practice of intention. And through that intention is how we will ultimately succeed in realizing our mission and vision.
* **Embrace Accountability:** We are imperfect in our actions, results, and even sometimes our intentions. By making accountability a practice, we destigmatize failure, increase trust with others, and accelerate learning both at the individual and the team level.
* **Practice a Growth Mindset:** Growth comes at the edge of our comfort zone. We repeatedly place ourselves there by risking failure and embracing the challenges that failure presents us to own our growth and support others in theirs.
* **Be You:** We want people to show up as they are because that creates a healthier, more dynamic, and effective work environment. Just as much to do with being oneself, it’s everyone’s responsibility to create space for others to be their authentic self as well.

Our customers span all industries, and they count on CrowdStrike to keep their businesses running, their communities safe and their lives moving forward. We’re also a mission-driven company.

We’re always looking to add talented CrowdStrikers to the team who have limitless passion, a relentless focus on innovation and a fanatical commitment to our customers, our community and each other. Ready to join a mission that matters? The future of cybersecurity starts with you.

About the Role:

CrowdStrike is the industry-defining cybersecurity company. We are on a trajectory to $10B in revenue and beyond, and we are betting on Enterprise AI to supercharge that journey.

We are seeking a visionary Vice President to architect and lead our AI Center of Excellence (CoE). This is not a theoretical role; it is an operational leadership position tasked with deploying the next generation of agentic systems and AI-driven workflows across our entire enterprise. You will bridge the gap between technical possibility and business reality, translating complex AI capabilities into scalable solutions that drive GTM velocity, R&D innovation, and operational efficiency.

You will be the internal champion for our ""AI-First"" ambition, ensuring that every CrowdStriker—from HR to Sales to Engineering—is empowered by secure, resilient, and responsible AI.

What You'll Do:

Strategic Leadership & Governance

* Define the Enterprise AI Roadmap: Own the company-wide internal strategy for AI platforms, tools, and capabilities. Align AI initiatives directly with the $10B revenue goal and OPEX optimization targets.
* Lead the AI Center of Excellence: Build and manage a high-performing cross-functional team (Product Managers, Engineers, Analysts) to serve as the engine of AI transformation.
* Executive Leadership: Chair the AI SteerCo, driving prioritization, investment strategy, and buy-vs-build decisions with the C-Suite and executive leadership.

Execution & Transformation

* Transform through the coordinated deployment of agentic systems: Enable implementation of intelligent, autonomous workflows that redefine operational models across the enterprise.

* Drive Productivity Step-Change: Identify and align teams to execute on opportunities to bend the OPEX growth curve with a focus on hyper-automation and process re-engineering.
* Innovation Scouting: Continuously assess the emerging technology landscape (Generative AI, LLMs, Autonomous Agents) to keep CrowdStrike at the forefront of internal innovation.

The Candidate Profile

We are looking for a rare hybrid: a strategist with the soul of a technologist, and a technologist with the polish of a management consultant.

What You'll Need:

* Executive Gravity: 15+ years of experience, with a proven track record of leading enterprise-wide transformation initiatives in high-growth, large-scale organizations.
* AI Fluency: Deep understanding of the current AI landscape, specifically Generative AI, agentic capabilities, and Large Language Models (LLMs). You know the difference between hype and high-impact utility.
* Strong Executive Leadership: Demonstrated ability to lead executive-level steering committees, influence C-level decision-making, and secure investment for technology initiatives.
* Technical Leadership: Experience managing technical teams (Data Science, Engineering) and partnering with Product Engineering organizations.
* Operational Rigor: Strong background in business process automation. You understand the ecosystems of CRM, ERP, and Enterprise Data Lakes and how to modernize them.

Preferred Attributes:

* Consulting DNA: Background in top-tier management consulting, with expertise in operational efficiency and digital strategy.
* Governance Expertise: Experience developing AI ethics policies, risk assessments, and regulatory compliance frameworks.
* ""Customer Zero"" Mindset: Experience implementing a company’s own technology internally to drive product feedback loops.

If you’re excited to build and scale modern, automated quality practices (including AI-assisted testing) in a clean SDLC, this role is for you.

Join Toshiba’s Global Commerce Solutions Digital Transformation group as a senior Quality leader supporting Professional Services programs across Retail customers.

The Software Quality Director (Professional Services – Retail) owns the end-to-end quality strategy and execution for customer-facing programs, ensuring releases are reliable, scalable, secure, and operationally ready for real-world retail environments. You will operate as a trusted advisor to customer leadership and internal executives—aligning quality plans to business use cases, requirements, store operations, and rollout objectives.

This role sets the vision for scalable quality engineering, modern test automation, performance validation, and AI-enabled test planning/execution. You will lead QA managers and partner closely with Professional Services, Product, Engineering, Support, Security, and Customer Success to ensure quality is measurable, transparent, and outcome-driven.

  

**Key Responsibilities:**

**Customer leadership partnership (Retail Professional Services)**

* Serve as a high-level quality advisor to customer leadership (e.g., VP/Director of IT, Operations, Store Systems), aligning on success metrics, risks, rollout readiness, and operational acceptance criteria.
* Translate business objectives (store uptime, transaction integrity, associate productivity, inventory accuracy, rollout timelines) into test strategies and release gates.
* Lead joint customer/internal reviews on quality status, defect trends, go/no-go readiness, and post-release learnings.

**Quality strategy focused on business outcomes**

* Define and drive a QA strategy that is anchored in retail business use cases, workflows, and operational scenarios—not just process compliance.
* Ensure requirements are testable, traceable, and aligned to customer value (e.g., POS flows, promotions, loyalty, back office, device workflows, integrations).
* Build practical quality governance that complements Agile delivery while prioritizing operational reliability and measurable outcomes.

**AI-enabled test planning and execution**

* Incorporate AI to accelerate test design, scenario generation, risk-based prioritization, test data creation, defect clustering, and regression selection.
* Establish standards to ensure AI-assisted testing is explainable, secure, auditable, and improves coverage/efficiency without sacrificing rigor.

**Modern quality engineering & automation**

* Scale automation across UI/API/integration layers; expand continuous testing in CI/CD with clear quality gates.
* Drive performance, reliability, and scale validation aligned to retail peak periods and store/network variability.
* Strengthen test environments, test data management, observability, and release readiness playbooks.

**Leadership & capability building**

* Lead, mentor, and grow QA leaders and engineers across functional, automated, performance, and systems testing.
* Embed with delivery teams when needed to model best practices and unblock quality risks.
* Establish consistent metrics (defect leakage, escaped defects, coverage, cycle time, reliability, customer incidents) and use them to drive improvement.

**Duties & Deliverables**

* Develop and maintain quality roadmaps aligned to Professional Services program plans and customer rollout waves.
* Create risk-based test strategies covering functional, integration, system, regression, performance, usability, and operational readiness.
* Author/review lifecycle deliverables: customer-facing quality plans, test reports, traceability, release readiness criteria, and risk assessments.
* Ensure defect management discipline: triage, prioritization aligned to business impact, and closure transparency.
* Partner with Security to incorporate cybersecurity and risk assessments appropriate for retail deployments.
* Own the quality tooling ecosystem: requirements/test management, CI pipelines, reporting dashboards, and test environments.

  

**Must Have Requirements:**

* Bachelor’s degree (or higher) in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or equivalent experience.
* 10+ years in software quality assurance / quality engineering, including automation and test strategy ownership.
* 8+ years leading teams/managers; demonstrated ability to scale practices across multiple initiatives.
* Strong customer-facing leadership experience—able to communicate with and influence customer executives and internal senior leaders (SVP/CTO-level).
* Proven ability to drive quality based on business use cases, requirements clarity, and operational workflows.
* Experience delivering B2B and/or B2C software in production environments with uptime and performance expectations.
* Expertise with SDLC tooling (requirements, CI/CD, test management, defect tracking) and metrics-driven quality management.
* Excellent communication skills (written and verbal); able to produce clear customer-ready plans and executive updates.

**Preferred:**

* Retail domain experience (POS, payments, promotions, loyalty, store systems, peripherals, integrations).
* Hands-on experience applying AI/ML tools to testing (scenario generation, risk prioritization, regression optimization, defect analytics).
* Programming/scripting experience (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java, C#) and modern automation frameworks.
* Experience in regulated/validated environments and traceability documentation (a plus, not required).

We’re looking for a hands-on technical leader to architect, fine-tune, and deploy on-device small language models (SLMs) for consumer security at scale. You’ll lead a focused team of 3–5 senior engineers while remaining deeply involved in the code and technical architecture.
  
  
Your core responsibility is building high-performance, privacy-preserving AI models that run directly on user devices (Mac, iOS, Android, Linux). You’ll own model optimization, fine-tuning for tool-use accuracy, evaluation frameworks, and cost-aware deployment strategies. While you won’t own the agent orchestration platform itself, you’ll work closely with it to ensure models behave correctly in multi-turn conversations and make reliable tool-calling decisions.
  
  
This role sits at the intersection of edge ML, applied LLMs, and production engineering. Success requires navigating real-world tradeoffs: latency vs. capability, privacy vs. accuracy, on-device vs. cloud execution, and cost vs. performance.
  
  
This is not a traditional director role. You’ll spend 60%+ of your time on technical architecture and implementation, with the remainder focused on mentoring senior engineers and setting technical direction.
  
  
This is a Hybrid remote position located in a hub location of Frisco, TX or San Jose, CA. You will be required to be onsite on an as-needed basis, typically 1-4 days per month. We are only considering candidates within a commutable distance to this location and are not offering relocation assistance at this time.

**About the role:**

* Design and deploy small language models optimized for on-device inference (Mac, iOS, Android, Linux)
* Lead model optimization efforts including quantization, pruning, distillation, and efficient inference pipelines
* Fine-tune models to improve tool selection accuracy and conversational behavior in security-focused workflows
* Build evaluation frameworks to measure model efficacy, tool-calling accuracy, conversation quality, and safety in production
* Create synthetic data and workflow simulations to train and validate security-relevant conversations
* Partner closely with agent orchestration systems to optimize multi-turn dialogue behavior and state handling
* Implement cost-optimization strategies such as intelligent on-device vs. cloud routing, prompt caching, batching, and token efficiency
* Integrate cloud-based LLMs when deeper reasoning or broader context is required
* Build production ML systems that detect threats and protect users directly on-device
* Set technical standards and architectural direction for AI/ML across the security platform
* Mentor principal engineers and architects while remaining hands-on

**About you:**

* 10+ years of software engineering experience, with 5+ years focused on ML/AI
* Proven experience shipping ML models to production with transferrable skills to deploy these on edge or mobile platforms
* Experience with conversational AI systems and tool/function-calling architectures
* Strong Python and systems programming skills (C++ or Rust) for performance-critical code
* Deep expertise in model optimization (INT4/INT8 quantization, pruning, distillation)
* Hands-on experience with PyTorch and at least one edge deployment framework (TensorFlow Lite, CoreML, ONNX Runtime, or llama.cpp)
* Experience building evaluation and benchmarking frameworks for ML systems

Preferred:

* Experience applying ML systems in security, safety, or other adversarial domains
* Master’s degree in CS, ML, or a related field (or equivalent practical experience)

**Ready for a real challenge?**

If you're intellectually curious, adaptable, and excited about being at the forefront of AI-driven transformation - not just watching from the sidelines - we want to talk.

**Role Overview**

GAPVelocity AI is the AI-first modernization business unit of Growth Acceleration Partners (GAP), a leading consulting and technology services provider specializing in custom software, data engineering, and modernization solutions. Our unique Hybrid AI architecture rapidly transforms legacy applications, making us the go-to partner for enterprises aiming to modernize and leverage AI for competitive advantage. The enterprise AI modernization market is experiencing explosive growth with companies seeking to transform legacy systems. Our proprietary Hybrid AI architecture solves what others can’t - enabling rapid, risk-free application migration that competitors can’t touch.

We’re on a mission to scale the Business Unit to $50 million in annual revenue, and we’re searching for consultative and value-driven sales professionals ready to make an immediate and lasting impact.

**About the Role:** You'll be a critical player in our growth strategy. Our intentional focus for this role is one of a strategic and consultative approach - selling transformative AI-driven migration solutions and complementary GAP Engineering services to enterprise decision-makers.

You'll excel by navigating complex organizations, engaging senior stakeholders, and becoming a trusted advisor who lands and expands within accounts. We're looking for self-starters who can hunt for new opportunities, not just handle inbound leads, and who use persuasion and collaboration rather than confrontation to drive internal and external results.

**The ideal candidate brings:**

* A track record of **enterprise technology sales** - specifically selling to CIOs and technology leaders who are making platform and architecture decisions. You've sold solutions where technical debt, platform risk, or application modernization were central to the buyer's decision.
* **Hunter DNA** - You've built pipeline from scratch, not just inherited accounts. You're energized by prospecting, competitive displacement, and winning net-new logos.
* **Comfort with complexity** - You've navigated 6-8 month sales cycles involving multiple stakeholders, technical validation, and enterprise buying committees. You know how to quarterback complex deals without losing momentum.
* **Technical aptitude** - You don't need to be an engineer, but you need to get excited about learning technical concepts. You can grasp how AI transforms legacy code and explain it in business terms. You ask probing questions about how things work, not just what they cost.
* **Intellectual flexibility** - You've succeeded by adapting your approach to each situation, not by rigidly following the same playbook. You can read the room, pivot your strategy, and figure out what works for each unique buyer.
* **10+ years of proven success** - You've consistently hit quota selling complex technology solutions. You can point to specific examples of deals you've won through persistence, creativity, and deep customer understanding.

**Bonus points if you have:**

* Direct experience selling **legacy application modernization or migration platforms/tools** (VB6, PowerBuilder, Clarion, COBOL, etc.)
* Background in the **Microsoft partner ecosystem** or cloud migration partnerships
* Proven success in **manufacturing, financial services, or insurance verticals**
* Existing relationships with enterprise CIOs at **30+ year old companies**

**You'll thrive in this role if:**

* **You're intellectually curious** - You ask ""how does this actually work?"" not just ""what's the ROI?"" You want to understand the technology deeply enough to have credible conversations with technical executives.
* **You adapt and learn quickly** - This isn't about executing the same playbook you've run for 10 years. Every enterprise has unique legacy challenges. You'll need to learn on the fly, pivot your approach, and figure things out as you go.
* **You're building something, not just selling something** - We're establishing a new category in AI-driven modernization. You'll help define how we go to market, not inherit a well-worn path. If you need everything figured out for you, this isn't the role.
* **You're genuinely excited about AI** - Not because it's a buzzword, but because you see how transformative it is for solving real technical problems. You want to be part of this revolution while it's happening, not read about it later.
* **You have grit** - These are complex, high-stakes deals with long cycles. You'll face rejection, technical objections, and buying committees. You need the persistence to push through without losing momentum or enthusiasm.
* **You bring enterprise discipline** - You run a tight sales process (MEDDIC, BANT, or similar), maintain meticulous pipeline hygiene, and can forecast accurately. But you know when to follow the process and when to break it.

**Key Responsibilities:**

* Execute a consultative sales approach, effectively articulating the strategic value of GAPVelocity AI's AI-driven migration solutions.

**Ready for a real challenge?**

If you're intellectually curious, adaptable, and excited about being at the forefront of AI-driven transformation - not just watching from the sidelines - we want to talk.

**Role Overview**

GAPVelocity AI is the AI-first modernization business unit of Growth Acceleration Partners (GAP), a leading consulting and technology services provider specializing in custom software, data engineering, and modernization solutions. Our unique Hybrid AI architecture rapidly transforms legacy applications, making us the go-to partner for enterprises aiming to modernize and leverage AI for competitive advantage. The enterprise AI modernization market is experiencing explosive growth with companies seeking to transform legacy systems. Our proprietary Hybrid AI architecture solves what others can’t - enabling rapid, risk-free application migration that competitors can’t touch.

We’re on a mission to scale the Business Unit to $50 million in annual revenue, and we’re searching for consultative and value-driven sales professionals ready to make an immediate and lasting impact.

**About the Role:** You'll be a critical player in our growth strategy. Our intentional focus for this role is one of a strategic and consultative approach - selling transformative AI-driven migration solutions and complementary GAP Engineering services to enterprise decision-makers.

You'll excel by navigating complex organizations, engaging senior stakeholders, and becoming a trusted advisor who lands and expands within accounts. We're looking for self-starters who can hunt for new opportunities, not just handle inbound leads, and who use persuasion and collaboration rather than confrontation to drive internal and external results.

**The ideal candidate brings:**

* A track record of **enterprise technology sales** - specifically selling to CIOs and technology leaders who are making platform and architecture decisions. You've sold solutions where technical debt, platform risk, or application modernization were central to the buyer's decision.
* **Hunter DNA** - You've built pipeline from scratch, not just inherited accounts. You're energized by prospecting, competitive displacement, and winning net-new logos.
* **Comfort with complexity** - You've navigated 6-8 month sales cycles involving multiple stakeholders, technical validation, and enterprise buying committees. You know how to quarterback complex deals without losing momentum.
* **Technical aptitude** - You don't need to be an engineer, but you need to get excited about learning technical concepts. You can grasp how AI transforms legacy code and explain it in business terms. You ask probing questions about how things work, not just what they cost.
* **Intellectual flexibility** - You've succeeded by adapting your approach to each situation, not by rigidly following the same playbook. You can read the room, pivot your strategy, and figure out what works for each unique buyer.
* **10+ years of proven success** - You've consistently hit quota selling complex technology solutions. You can point to specific examples of deals you've won through persistence, creativity, and deep customer understanding.

**Bonus points if you have:**

* Direct experience selling **legacy application modernization or migration platforms/tools** (VB6, PowerBuilder, Clarion, COBOL, etc.)
* Background in the **Microsoft partner ecosystem** or cloud migration partnerships
* Proven success in **manufacturing, financial services, or insurance verticals**
* Existing relationships with enterprise CIOs at **30+ year old companies**

**You'll thrive in this role if:**

* **You're intellectually curious** - You ask ""how does this actually work?"" not just ""what's the ROI?"" You want to understand the technology deeply enough to have credible conversations with technical executives.
* **You adapt and learn quickly** - This isn't about executing the same playbook you've run for 10 years. Every enterprise has unique legacy challenges. You'll need to learn on the fly, pivot your approach, and figure things out as you go.
* **You're building something, not just selling something** - We're establishing a new category in AI-driven modernization. You'll help define how we go to market, not inherit a well-worn path. If you need everything figured out for you, this isn't the role.
* **You're genuinely excited about AI** - Not because it's a buzzword, but because you see how transformative it is for solving real technical problems. You want to be part of this revolution while it's happening, not read about it later.
* **You have grit** - These are complex, high-stakes deals with long cycles. You'll face rejection, technical objections, and buying committees. You need the persistence to push through without losing momentum or enthusiasm.
* **You bring enterprise discipline** - You run a tight sales process (MEDDIC, BANT, or similar), maintain meticulous pipeline hygiene, and can forecast accurately. But you know when to follow the process and when to break it.

**Key Responsibilities:**

* Execute a consultative sales approach, effectively articulating the strategic value of GAPVelocity AI's AI-driven migration solutions.
* Consistently meet or exceed quarterly and annual revenue targets, playing a pivotal role in driving GAPVelocity AI’s rapid growth trajectory.
* Proactively identify and develop new opportunities, engaging senior decision-makers to secure budget approval and strategic alignment.
* Collaborate with internal teams, including becoming a two-in-a-box champion with Solution Architects, and Delivery manager as well as closely align with Engineering,and Marketing, to provide seamless client experiences and expand account revenue.
* Champion and sell GAP's broader portfolio of services to existing and new clients, maximizing revenue opportunities through upselling and cross-selling.

You’ll be supported by:

* Growth engine generating qualified leads
* Solution Architects providing technical expertise on client calls
* Marketing driven lead generation campaigns and content resources
* CRM and AI sales automation tools
* Ongoing sales training and AI certification programs

**Why GAPVelocity AI?**

* Join an innovative team leading the charge in AI-driven application migration and modernization.

**About the Role:** You'll be a critical player in our growth strategy. Our intentional focus for this role is one of a strategic and consultative approach - selling transformative AI-driven migration solutions and complementary GAP Engineering services to enterprise decision-makers.

You'll excel by navigating complex organizations, engaging senior stakeholders, and becoming a trusted advisor who lands and expands within accounts. We're looking for self-starters who can hunt for new opportunities, not just handle inbound leads, and who use persuasion and collaboration rather than confrontation to drive internal and external results.

**The ideal candidate brings:**

* A track record of **enterprise technology sales** - specifically selling to CIOs and technology leaders who are making platform and architecture decisions. You've sold solutions where technical debt, platform risk, or application modernization were central to the buyer's decision.
* **Hunter DNA** - You've built pipeline from scratch, not just inherited accounts. You're energized by prospecting, competitive displacement, and winning net-new logos.
* **Comfort with complexity** - You've navigated 6-8 month sales cycles involving multiple stakeholders, technical validation, and enterprise buying committees. You know how to quarterback complex deals without losing momentum.
* **Technical aptitude** - You don't need to be an engineer, but you need to get excited about learning technical concepts. You can grasp how AI transforms legacy code and explain it in business terms. You ask probing questions about how things work, not just what they cost.
* **Intellectual flexibility** - You've succeeded by adapting your approach to each situation, not by rigidly following the same playbook. You can read the room, pivot your strategy, and figure out what works for each unique buyer.
* **10+ years of proven success** - You've consistently hit quota selling complex technology solutions. You can point to specific examples of deals you've won through persistence, creativity, and deep customer understanding.

**Bonus points if you have:**

* Direct experience selling **legacy application modernization or migration platforms/tools** (VB6, PowerBuilder, Clarion, COBOL, etc.)
* Background in the **Microsoft partner ecosystem** or cloud migration partnerships
* Proven success in **manufacturing, financial services, or insurance verticals**
* Existing relationships with enterprise CIOs at **30+ year old companies**

**You'll thrive in this role if:**

* **You're intellectually curious** - You ask ""how does this actually work?"" not just ""what's the ROI?"" You want to understand the technology deeply enough to have credible conversations with technical executives.
* **You adapt and learn quickly** - This isn't about executing the same playbook you've run for 10 years. Every enterprise has unique legacy challenges. You'll need to learn on the fly, pivot your approach, and figure things out as you go.
* **You're building something, not just selling something** - We're establishing a new category in AI-driven modernization. You'll help define how we go to market, not inherit a well-worn path. If you need everything figured out for you, this isn't the role.
* **You're genuinely excited about AI** - Not because it's a buzzword, but because you see how transformative it is for solving real technical problems. You want to be part of this revolution while it's happening, not read about it later.
* **You have grit** - These are complex, high-stakes deals with long cycles. You'll face rejection, technical objections, and buying committees. You need the persistence to push through without losing momentum or enthusiasm.
* **You bring enterprise discipline** - You run a tight sales process (MEDDIC, BANT, or similar), maintain meticulous pipeline hygiene, and can forecast accurately. But you know when to follow the process and when to break it.

**Key Responsibilities:**

* Execute a consultative sales approach, effectively articulating the strategic value of GAPVelocity AI's AI-driven migration solutions.
* Consistently meet or exceed quarterly and annual revenue targets, playing a pivotal role in driving GAPVelocity AI’s rapid growth trajectory.

**About Salesforce**

Salesforce is the #1 AI CRM, where humans with agents drive customer success together. Here, ambition meets action. Tech meets trust. And innovation isn’t a buzzword — it’s a way of life. The world of work as we know it is changing and we're looking for Trailblazers who are passionate about bettering business and the world through AI, driving innovation, and keeping Salesforce's core values at the heart of it all.

Ready to level-up your career at the company leading workforce transformation in the agentic era? You’re in the right place! Agentforce is the future of AI, and you are the future of Salesforce.

We are seeking a visionary, strategic, and experienced senior product leader with a proven track record of driving new product capabilities from initial concept to market leadership. Reporting directly to the Chief Product Officer (CPO), you will be the chief strategist and evangelist responsible for driving the future of the AI portfolio for our Field Service & Operations Cloud. Working with product leaders from across the business, you will define and deliver a market leading portfolio of AI solutions. And, most importantly, you will work directly with customers to ensure our most advanced technology solutions lead to tangible enterprise outcomes.

Field Service & Operations organizations are navigating a once-in-a-generation shift driven by AI. They are pivoting from reactive to predictive service organizations, redefining how they manage their workforces, assets and operations. In this role, you are at the helm of this transformation. You will define what ""AI in Field Service & Operations"" means for the market—shaping a narrative that moves the industry from simple automation to intelligent, autonomous operations. By guiding thousands of companies toward higher first-time-fix rates and smarter dispatching, you will establish the benchmark for how AI is deployed at scale in the physical world.

This leader will be accountable for delivering product innovations, driving adoption and customer success with our AI solutions, and delivering tangible revenue growth, working in strong collaboration with go-to-market strategy, sales, marketing, and engineering organizations.

* Define and Evangelize the Global Vision : Build and articulate a compelling vision for the future of Field Service, specifically focusing on how AI and agentic capabilities will revolutionize asset management and dispatching.
* Global Evangelism & Market Presence : Serve as the primary global voice for Field Service AI. This includes attending major events in global hubs and leading high-stakes sessions with international customer executives to establish a market-leading position.
* Lead the Product Portfolio (Matrixed Leadership) : Own and drive a cohesive AI narrative across the entire business. Ensure cross-pillar cohesion and prevent siloed development by aligning teams such as Field Agent and Dispatch Agent behind a unified roadmap.
* Drive AI-Native Experiences : Partner closely with R&D and platform teams to ensure the right priorities land in the roadmap, unblocking delivery challenges to embed AI across every layer of service delivery.
* Drive Strategic Partnerships & Platform Integration : Lead cross-functional collaboration with platform teams and diverse business lines to identify synergies that accelerate innovation. Focus on creating integrated workflows that unlock new monetization opportunities and expand the AI value proposition across the enterprise.
* Commercial Strategy & Revenue Accountability : Shape the pricing, packaging, and positioning strategy. Take direct accountability for growth in the ""Agentforce for Field Service"" add-on offering and overall revenue generated through the consumption of AI solutions.
* Champion Customer Transformation : Design and scale customer success programs and adoption playbooks. Track rigorous KPIs such as first-time-fix rates and workforce productivity to prove the value of AI adoption.

Qualifications:

* Experience : Equivalent of 15+ years of product management or similar experience, with a significant portion in senior executive leadership roles within complex, matrixed organizations.
* Matrixed Leadership Excellence : Proven ability to influence, inspire, and align multiple business units and global teams without direct reporting authority.
* AI Technical Acumen : Strong understanding of key AI technologies, specifically including LLMs, predictive AI and computer vision models
* Strategic & Execution-Oriented : A track record of launching ""0 1"" products and scaling them; able to define the big picture while ensuring the velocity of delivery.
* Global Communication & Presence : Exceptional storyteller with executive presence; able to travel internationally and effectively influence C-level stakeholders across diverse cultures and markets.

Domain Expertise : Deep expertise in Field Service, customer operations, workforce management, or industrial technology.

London / Full-Remote (based in UK)

Company: l'entreprise

Type: Full-time – Permanent

Attractive package, to discuss

### **About l'entreprise**

Founded in 2016 and based in Lausanne, Switzerland, the company's mission is to help organizations leverage satellite, aerial, or drone imagery to extract actionable insights using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.

**What they offer:**

* **Cloud-native SaaS platform (“GeoAI”)** : users can design, train, deploy, and manage machine learning models for geospatial image analysis.
* **No-code interface** : even non-technical users can create models for object detection or change detection in images (e.g., buildings, solar panels, farmland, mining equipment).
* **Strong focus on impact & compliance** : e.g., their ""Tracer” solution enables traceability of raw materials (wood, palm oil, soy) to monitor plots, define boundaries, and assess compliance with environmental regulations like the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR).
* **Multi-sector applications** : agriculture, forestry, mining, urban planning, infrastructure, supply chains.

**Example projects:**

* A raw materials sourcing company used this solution to analyze over 500,000 plots to assess deforestation risks and ensure EUDR compliance in its supply chain.
* An agriculture company monitored more than 90,000 farms to track soil health, erosion, and water retention across its supply chain using the company's GeoAI platform.

**Benefits / Why it’s useful:**

* **Time & cost savings** : automation and no-code interface significantly reduce development time compared to traditional geospatial image analysis methods.
* **Improved visibility & decision-making** : organizations move from periodic reports to continuous monitoring (e.g., plots, forests, infrastructure) and can act more agilely.
* **Accessibility** : by making geospatial AI more “mainstream,” l'entreprise enables use cases in sectors without highly specialized data science teams.

**Company context:**

* Excellent communication; native English required (a second European language is a plus).
Experience in the UK market.

**Nice-to-have**

* Knowledge of geospatial sector, AI applied to imagery, or environmental compliance (EUDR).
Experience in a high-growth SaaS scale-up.

**What they value most**

* A strong personality: someone driven, ambitious, and not afraid to take on challenges.
* Self-belief and proactivity.
* Experience matters, but motivation, energy, and mindset are even more important.

### **Why join l'entreprise?**

* Unique, differentiating technology in a rapidly evolving sector (geospatial + AI + compliance).
* Stimulating environment combining tech, AI, environment, and impact.
* Opportunity to build the Enterprise Sales function in a growing organization.

We believe that world models are at the frontier of progress in artificial intelligence. Language models alone won’t solve the world’s hardest problems – robotics, disease, scientific discovery. Real progress requires models that experience the world and learn from their mistakes, the same way that humans do. And this kind of trial and error can be massively accelerated when done in simulation, rather than in the real world.  
  
World models offer the most clear path to general-purpose simulation, changing how stories are told, how scientific progress is made and how the next frontiers of humanity are reached.

Our team consists of creative, open minded, caring and ambitious people who are determined to change the world. We aspire to continuously build impossible things and our ability to do so relies on building an incredible team. If you are driven to do the same, we'd love to hear from you.

### **About the role**

* *Open to hiring remote across North America— we also have offices in NYC, San Francisco and Seattle.*

You'll build Runway's Physical AI business from early pilots to production. Your job is to turn research capability into customer outcomes - proving that our world models deliver results that transfer to the real world.

This is an early-stage role with significant upside. You'll work directly with customers, shape the product, and define a new market.

### **Responsibilities**

* Own the Physical AI business from pilot to production
* Run forward-deployed programs with robotics and autonomy customers
* Translate customer needs into product and research priorities
* Build partnerships that establish Runway as credible in the space
* Align engineering, design, and research partners around priorities
* Grow the team as revenue justifies

### **What We're Looking For**

* Deep understanding of robotics, autonomy, or simulation
* Can speak credibly with technical customers
* Comfortable building from pilot stage
* Willing to run customer engagements directly

Runway strives to recruit and retain exceptional talent from diverse backgrounds while ensuring pay equity for our team. Our salary ranges are based on competitive market rates for our size, stage and industry, and salary is just one part of the overall compensation package we provide.

There are many factors that go into salary determinations, including relevant experience, skill level and qualifications assessed during the interview process, and maintaining internal equity with peers on the team. The range shared below is a general expectation for the function as posted, but we are also open to considering candidates who may be more or less experienced than outlined in the job description. In this case, we will communicate any updates in the expected salary range.

Lastly, the provided range is the expected salary for candidates in the U.S. Outside of those regions, there may be a change in the range, which again, will be communicated to candidates.

Salary range: $280,000-$350,000

### **Working at Runway**

**Great things come from great teams.** **We’d love to hear from you.**

We’re committed to creating a space where our employees can bring their full selves to work and have equal opportunity to succeed. So regardless of race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, origin, ability, age, veteran status, if joining this mission speaks to you, we encourage you to apply.","We are building AI to simulate the world through merging art and science.

PayPal has been revolutionizing commerce globally for more than 25 years. Creating innovative experiences that make moving money, selling, and shopping simple, personalized, and secure, PayPal empowers consumers and businesses in approximately 200 markets to join and thrive in the global economy.

We operate a global, two-sided network at scale that connects hundreds of millions of merchants and consumers. We help merchants and consumers connect, transact, and complete payments, whether they are online or in person. PayPal is more than a connection to third-party payment networks. We provide proprietary payment solutions accepted by merchants that enable the completion of payments on our platform on behalf of our customers.

We offer our customers the flexibility to use their accounts to purchase and receive payments for goods and services, as well as the ability to transfer and withdraw funds. We enable consumers to exchange funds more safely with merchants using a variety of funding sources, which may include a bank account, a PayPal or Venmo account balance, PayPal and Venmo branded credit products, a credit card, a debit card, certain cryptocurrencies, or other stored value products such as gift cards, and eligible credit card rewards. Our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products also make it safer and simpler for friends and family to transfer funds to each other. We offer merchants an end-to-end payments solution that provides authorization and settlement capabilities, as well as instant access to funds and payouts. We also help merchants connect with their customers, process exchanges and returns, and manage risk. We enable consumers to engage in cross-border shopping and merchants to extend their global reach while reducing the complexity and friction involved in enabling cross-border trade.

Our beliefs are the foundation for how we conduct business every day. We live each day guided by our core values of Inclusion, Innovation, Collaboration, and Wellness. Together, our values ensure that we work together as one global team with our customers at the center of everything we do – and they push us to ensure we take care of ourselves, each other, and our communities.

Job Description Summary: The Opportunity: Shaping the Future of Trust We are seeking a visionary Senior Director of Risk Data Science to architect and lead the next generation of our fraud prevention capabilities.

In this role, you will be the technical conscience and strategic driver for a team that processes billions of transactions. You will lead the charge in embedding deep learning, graph neural networks (GNNs), and large, complex language models into the very fabric of our real-time decisioning engines. You will own the ""brain"" that protects our customers from increasingly sophisticated threats—spanning identity theft, synthetic fraud, account takeovers, and scams—before they happen.

Job Description:

* Deploy and maintain ML solutions in production environments.
* Collaborate with cross-functional teams to integrate ML models into products and services.
* Monitor and evaluate the performance of deployed models, making necessary adjustments.
* Mentor and guide junior engineers and data scientists.
* Publish research findings and contribute to industry discussions.
* Represent the company at conferences and external engagements.
* Influence the direction of the company's AI/ML strategy and contribute to long-term planning.

**Expected Qualifications:**

* 12+ years relevant experience and a Bachelor’s degree OR Any equivalent combination of education and experience.
* 5 years of experience leading others

Additional\_Responsibilities\_And\_Preferred\_Qualifications:

At PayPal, we are not just moving money; we are securing the global economy. As we accelerate our journey to become an AI-first fintech leader, the Global Risk Management organization has moved to the absolute front and center of our strategy. We are undergoing a massive transformation—moving from reactive fraud detection to proactive, autonomous fraud prevention powered by cutting-edge Applied AI and Machine Learning.

Your Mission

* Elevate Fraud Prevention to an Art Form: Drive the shift from traditional predictive modeling to adaptive, self-learning AI systems that anticipate fraud vectors before they scale.
* Lead with Technical Authority: Serve as a primary decision-maker for the modeling architectures that underpin PayPal’s global security, balancing sub-millisecond latency requirements with state-of the-art precision.
* Influence at the Highest Levels: Act as a key partner to product and engineering executive leadership, ensuring that ""Safety and Security"" is a core feature of every product launch, from Venmo to Braintree and beyond.

Strategic Leadership & Vision  

* Partner with the VP of Risk Data Science & AI to define and execute the long-term AI/ML roadmap for Global Fraud Prevention, moving beyond iterative improvements to transformative leaps in detection capability.
* Champion the adoption of advanced methodologies—specifically Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and GenAI-driven anomaly detection—to identify bad actors within our complex ecosystem of two-sided networks.
* Spearhead innovations and transformations for modeling algorithms, technical infrastructure, and modeling platforms to help propel business forward with the power of ML/AI
* Partner closely with Global Fraud Prevention leadership to align data science initiatives with PayPal’s broader ""AI-First"" corporate strategy.

World-Class Modeling & Execution  

* End-to-End Ownership: Oversee the full lifecycle of mission-critical fraud models: from ideation and feature engineering (leveraging thousands of signals) to real-time production deployment and automated

retraining loops.  

* Vector-Specific Mastery: Own the decisioning engines for diverse fraud vectors including Identity & Onboarding, Authentication & Login, Payment Abuse, Social Engineering Scams, and regulatory compliance.
* Scale & Speed: Ensure all ML solutions are robust enough to handle PayPal’s massive scale (billions of daily events) and fast enough to deliver friction-free experiences for legitimate users.

Organizational Transformation & Mentorship  

* Build, mentor, and inspire a high-performing global team of Principal Data Scientists and Managers. Foster a culture of rigorous scientific inquiry, rapid experimentation, and intellectual honesty.
* Break down silos between Data Science, Engineering, and Product. Drive the ""Model-as-Product"" mindset where risk engines are treated as core assets.
* Represent PayPal’s technical prowess at top-tier industry conferences (e.g., Money20/20) and contribute to the broader scientific community through research publications.

Required Qualifications  

* Fraud Domain Expertise: Extensive, hands-on experience building and managing fraud prevention and / or fraud detection models using large-scale data and advanced ML and AI techniques
* 18+ Years of Technical Experience: Proven track record of building and mentoring expert AI/ML teams that consistently deliver innovative solutions, resulting in measurable business impact and sustained competitive advantage
* 5+ Years of Executive Leadership: Experience managing large, multi-layered data science teams (managing managers) and influencing VP/C-level stakeholders.

Preferred Qualifications  

* Fintech & Payments DNA: Deep familiarity with the payments ecosystem (issuing, acquiring, gateways, ACH/Rails) and the unique adversarial nature of financial fraud.
* Advanced Degree: Ph.D. in Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics, Physics, Operations Research, or a related quantitative field is highly preferred.
* Applied AI Scale: Experience deploying GNNs or Transformer-based models in a high-throughput, low latency production environment (not just offline research).
* Transformation Experience: A track record of modernizing legacy model stacks (e.g., moving from logistic regression/forests to Deep Learning/AI) in a large enterprise.

Why This Role?  

* Impact: Your work directly stops bad actors and protects the financial livelihoods of millions of people and businesses worldwide.
* Visibility: You will report into a leadership chain that views Data Science as the primary driver of business value, not a support function.
* Innovation: You will have access to one of the richest datasets in the world and the compute resources to solve problems that others can only theorize about.

**About Iserv**

At **Iserv**, we are redefining what it means to be a Managed Service Provider. We don't just fix computers; we empower businesses to navigate the future of work. By combining robust IT infrastructure with the transformative power of **Artificial Intelligence**, we help our clients secure their data, automate their workflows, and gain a competitive edge. We are an ""AI-First"" company, meaning we practice what we preach—constantly looking for smarter, faster ways to solve problems.

**The Role**

We are looking for a **Technical Client Success Manager** who acts as the strategic ""hub"" of our organization. You will sit at the intersection of Sales, Project Management, and Client Success.

This role requires more than just organization; it requires **innovation**. We need a multitasker who stays cool under pressure but also possesses a genuine passion for AI and automation. You will be the one ensuring our clients feel supported while simultaneously using the latest tech to streamline how that support happens.

If you are the type of person who sees a repetitive task and thinks, ""How can I automate this?"" or ""How can AI help me organize this data?""—you are the independent thinker we need.

**Key Responsibilities**

**1. Client Relationship & ""Future-Proofing""**

* Serve as the primary liaison for key accounts, ensuring they aren't just ""happy,"" but are successfully adopting the technology we deploy.
* Identify opportunities within existing client accounts where **AI or Automation solutions** could solve a business pain point, and tee these up for the Sales team.
* Conduct quarterly business reviews (QBRs) with a focus on value delivery and technology road-mapping.

**2. Sales Operations & Technical Coordination**

* Act as the bridge between Sales and Technical teams to validate complex orders. You ensure that what is sold is technically viable and properly licensed.
* Assist in the creation of Scopes of Work (SOW), utilizing your organizational skills to ensure no detail is missed during the quoting process.
* Maintain impeccable data hygiene in our CRM/PSA, potentially utilizing AI tools to summarize client interactions and action items.

**3. Onboarding & Project Liaison**

* Own the critical ""Sales-to-Operations"" handoff. You are responsible for ensuring the Project Management (PM) team has everything they need to start a project successfully.
* Manage client expectations during the onboarding phase, ensuring clear communication channels are established.
* Troubleshoot roadblocks during the provisioning process so the Sales team can focus on selling and the PM team can focus on deploying.

**4. Process Optimization (The ""AI Forward"" Aspect)**

* Be an internal champion for efficiency. Use your independent judgment to suggest new AI tools or automations that could make the Sales or Onboarding process faster.
* Stay educated on the rapidly changing AI landscape (Microsoft Copilot, ChatGPT, Automation platforms) to better converse with clients and improve your own productivity.

  

**What We Are Looking For**

**Core Attributes:**

* **Tech-Curious & AI-Forward:** You don't just tolerate new technology; you love it. You are likely the person your friends ask about the latest AI tools.
* **The ""Linchpin"":** You are excellent at connecting the dots. You know how to communicate technical constraints to salespeople and business urgency to engineers.
* **Structured yet Flexible:** You are highly organized (a master of the checklist), but you can pivot instantly when a high-priority client issue arises.
* **Independent Problem Solver:** You don't wait for permission to fix a broken process. You bring solutions to the table.

**Qualifications:**

* 2+ years of experience in an MSP, SaaS, or Technical Account Management role.
* **Passion for AI & Automation:** Demonstrated interest in or experience with using AI tools to increase productivity is a major plus.
* Strong understanding of the MSP lifecycle (Ticketing, Quoting, Onboarding).
* Experience with MSP tools (ConnectWise, Autotask, HubSpot, etc.) is preferred.
* Excellent written and verbal communication skills—you can translate ""Geek"" to ""English.""

  

**Why Join Iserv?**

* **Be on the Cutting Edge:** We are actively integrating AI into the MSP model. You will learn skills here that will define the next decade of the IT industry.
* **Impact:** You won't be a cog in a wheel. Your ability to organize and automate will directly impact our company's bottom line and efficiency.

Amazon Entertainment is seeking an experienced HR professional to architect our executive talent strategy for our Entertainment business – where creative-meets-technology-meets business across music, games, podcasts, and other mediums of entertainment.
  
  
This is an opportunity to influence how one of the world's most innovative companies develops its talent for the future. You’ll work directly with our senior Entertainment executives as we go all in with AI and shape the workforce transformation that’s to come.
  
  
This is not a talent acquisition or recruiting role. Those with experience as an HR Business Partner to senior executives, with strong business acumen, executive coaching expertise, organization design, excellent written and verbal communication skills, and robust project management capabilities often have the right translatable skills to be successful in this role. This person will also be comfortable with presenting regularly with executive and C-suite leaders, with the confidence to facilitate debate with leaders at this level.  
  
The right person for this role needs to thrive in dealing with a high level of ambiguity and feeling comfortable operating in a space with little direction for solving complex talent and organizational business problems. While we align with existing Amazon timelines on high level core talent activities (e.g., evaluation and assessment, promotions, annual talent reviews), this leader will help evolve our talent processes to fit Entertainment talent needs using creativity to design, build, and manage process execution for our Entertainment executives.  
  
About the Business:  
The role is part of the Amazon People eXperience and Technology (PXT) organization – we build a workplace for Amazonians to invent and deliver on behalf of customers. PXT for Amazon Entertainment supports a portfolio of entertainment businesses that span film, TV, live sports, music, podcasts, games, audiobooks, livestreaming, and other media content.

We customize for unique Entertainment business and industry needs where necessary and scale where possible and applicable. Our Entertainment employees deliver world-class products and services for playing, listening, watching, and streaming in an ever-immersive entertainment environment.  
  
Key job responsibilities  
This Executive Talent Lead’s responsibilities include building and continuously evolving Entertainment’s talent reviews and cyclical processes in close partnership with HR Business Partners, business leaders, analytics teams, and central Amazon talent leads. You will be a talent advisor to both business and HR leaders, and ensure we are constantly improving and scaling the services we provide.  
  
The ideal candidate must be a strong systems thinker with strong business acumen, ownership, grit, and drive for results. A successful candidate will have a demonstrated track record of:  

* Talent management execution. Design the overall talent review strategy focused on business-critical talent issues, which includes succession planning, talent development, long term talent planning, organizational reviews (and integrate with diversity and inclusion). Enhance and revisit executive level talent activities (Talent reviews, Career development, organizational capacity planning).
* Embracing ambiguity, and building structure where processes don’t yet exist. Understand all the connections and integration points through the entire talent management lifecycle, and using your program management expertise to lead the organization through these activities.
* Communicating with multiple stakeholders with concise, clear written and verbal methods. We are a document-heavy culture, which means we write, a lot, to share our ideas, our proposals, and everything else.
* Curiosity about your business. Learning your clients’ business, understanding their priorities, and recommending the best talent activities to help them meet their business customer needs.
* Building relationships and earning trust as a talent expert. Partnering with central team talent leaders, HR business partners, and business leaders and executives.
* Innovating with both simple yet creative solutions to address talent challenges.
* Operating with high judgment. There will be a constant flow of work, both tactical and strategic. Determine what gets done first and why, while managing a plan for what to do with everything else.
* Using research and data to inform your recommendations. We seek to be the most scientific HR organization in the world. We form hypotheses about the best talent management techniques and then set out to prove or disprove them with experiments and careful data collection. We pilot new ideas, measure and seek feedback, iterate and continuously improve.
* Resourcefulness. If you don’t know it, that’s ok. But you should know where to go for the answer or how to find out.

  
A day in the life  
This leader will quickly earn trust with HR peers, HR senior leaders, and business line leaders, and get deep in understanding specific areas of the Entertainment business. You will build cross-Amazon partnerships with Talent Management peers and within central Amazon PXT and Talent teams. Medium term projects include: leading our organization through talent processes (Q1 is our busiest talent season), evolving approaches to talent management for Entertainment talent, developing relevant internal communications mechanisms, and rethinking and redesigning talent management for professional creatives.

DataBank's managed data center services are anchored in world-class facilities. Our customized technology solutions are designed to help customers effectively manage risk, improve technology performance, and allow focus on core business objectives. DataBank is headquartered in the historic former Federal Reserve Bank Building, in downtown Dallas, TX.

DataBank is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer. Our work culture does not discriminate based on actual or perceived race, creed, color, religion, alienage or national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, age, disability or handicap, sex, marital status, veterans' status, gender, gender identity, gender expression, genetic information, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic protected by applicable federal, state, or local law.

We're looking for a hands-on Director of AI & Data Analytics who still loves getting their hands dirty in code. This isn't a ""pure management"" role where you sit in meetings all day – You’ll spend roughly 50% of your time leading and mentoring your team and other engineering members, and the remaining 50% hands-on, writing SQL, building data pipelines, architecting solutions, and tackling complex technical challenges directly.

You'll be the technical architect and strategic driver of DataBank's data and AI initiatives, turning our mountain of infrastructure, operations, and customer data into actual intelligence that people use. Think: predictive analytics that prevent problems before they happen, AI models that optimize efficiency across data centers, and self-service analytics that make everyone's life easier. The ideal candidate blends technical depth in data architecture, AI/ML engineering, and cloud analytics with a strong business sense for driving measurable outcomes.

**Key Responsibilities:**

Be the Data Whisperer: Building Business Intelligence & Insights

* Partner with leaders across the business to understand their data challenges (and translate ""I need a report"" into ""here's the insight you actually need"")
* Design and model data solutions that enable self-service analytics – because teaching people to fish is way better than becoming the company's fish-delivery service
* Build cross-functional relationships with engineering, product, finance, operations, and marketing teams who all have ""just one quick data question"" teams to quantify ROI and inform strategic decision-making
* Measure and report key business metrics, operational efficiency, customer growth, and service quality
* Mentor and align business analysts in other departments on their reporting strategies

AI & Analytics Strategy

* Define and execute a company-wide AI and analytics roadmap aligned with DataBank’s business and technology objectives

The Sponsored Products (SP) Detail Page Experience, Monetization, and Marketplace Intelligence team is responsible for building compelling advertising experiences on one of the most visited destinations on the internet—Amazon’s product detail pages. We focus on delivering personalized, context-aware ads that align with shopper preferences, adapt to seasonal and event-driven moments, and integrate naturally with organic content such as deals, new arrivals, basket-building features, and fast-delivery options. The team operates full-stack—from auction mechanisms to customer-facing experiences—working closely with Amazon Stores to drive the growth of SP on detail pages.  
  
Key job responsibilities  
We are seeking a seasoned and technically proficient leader to own and expand this space. As a single-threaded leader, you will guide the transformation of the detail page into a high-impact surface for product discovery and monetization through scalable, customer-centric advertising solutions—ranging from fully sponsored content to blended ad-organic formats. This role also entails end-to-end responsibility for marketplace operations, including auction allocation and pricing strategies. The successful candidate will apply a diverse set of signals, such as page context, shopper intent, seasonality, regional trends, delivery speed, and return likelihood, as well as deep learning and generative AI models to enhance customer experience, unlock incremental monetization, reduce cost to serve, and drive sustainable advertiser RoAS (return on ad spend). Additionally, the role involves developing real-time dynamic blending systems that optimize ad load and placement to balance business and customer outcomes.

This is a high-impact leadership role at the intersection of personalization, monetization, product innovation, marketplace dynamics, and machine learning—ideal for a strategic, technically fluent, and customer-obsessed leader ready to shape the future of Sponsored Products advertising on Amazon product detail pages.
